# ALMOG ARSENAL
This repository is a collection of tools, scripts, and resources for conducting security testing and ethical hacking on mobile devices, personal computers, and microcontrollers. Organized by platform and attack vector, it serves as a modular arsenal for penetration testers, red teamers, and researchers using environments like Linux (fedora and debian, for other distros check each tool you want to use), Android, and embedded systems.

part of this repository is also for general disruption and trolling. mostly it will just be my dump of cool tools I like so stay tuned
